# babbas-first-game
Very basic game written in Java. Collect all of the stars across 3 levels as fast as you can!
I created this game to give myself an introduction to game development. My goal was to create a small game with several levels, menu screens and a leaderboard. The project utilises the Slick2D library which is built on top of the Lightweight Java Game Library. Map data was implemented with help from Tiled, a free tile based map editor. All art was created by myself.
