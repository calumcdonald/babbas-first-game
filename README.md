# babbas-first-game
Very basic Java game using Slick2D. Collect all of the stars across 3 levels as fast as you can!
I created this game to give myself a small introduction to game development. I utilised the Slick2D library which is built on top of the Lightweight Java Game Library. I gave myself the challenge of creating a small game with several levels, menu screens and a leaderboard.
